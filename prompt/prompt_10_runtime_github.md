Use my Personal AI Design System from this GitHub repository:
https://github.com/hnhhngn/personal-ai-design-system.git

Read CURRENT.md to determine:

- Active spec
- Active contract
- Active token runtime
- Enabled / disabled features

Follow CURRENT.md strictly.
Do NOT assume or invent anything not explicitly enabled.

Auto-check (mandatory):
Before proceeding, confirm explicitly:

- You have read CURRENT.md
- You understand which features are enabled

Reply in the following format:
"RUNTIME OK — GitHub mode. Active files and features loaded."
